Chemotaxis
==========
Chemotaxis is when an organism moves toward or away from a chemical stimulus, like food. Biologists write software using [random walks](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/random.htm) to model and study [how very small organisms like bacteria search for food](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/). In this assignment you will create a simulation of organisms moving away from a starting position using a random walk. This assignment is similar in some ways to the ticklish penguin, but is different in that you must create a class to represent the organisms. To start the assignment, fork [this repository](https://github.com/APCSLowell/Chemotaxis). NOTE: you must use `Math.random()` for all the random numbers in this assignment. 

Requirements
============
This assignment will have a Bacteria class. The class Bacteria will have the following members:
- 3 ints which hold the x and y coordinates of the bacteria position, and the bacteria color.
- A constructor which initializes the 3 ints
- `void move()` which moves the bacteria in a random walk pattern.
- `void show()` which draws the bacteria in the correct position
   
Extensions
==========

If you have extra time, you might try to have the bacteria move in a "biased random walk" towards some stimulus like a piece of food or the mouse. You can modify your class so the bacteria have a finite lifespan and can reproduce. Your simulation doesn't have to look like mine. Have fun and be creative.
